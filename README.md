### Summary of the project:

I was responsible for designing and implementing a database from scratch based on user requirements. This involved every step of the database development lifecycle:

•	Requirement Analysis and Conceptual Design: I began by restructuring ambiguous user requirements into clear, actionable database requirements. This was followed by the creation of a detailed Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, complete with attribute domains, data dictionaries, and the definition of non-expressible constraints.

•	Logical and Physical Design: I then translated the ER diagram into a logical schema, optimizing it for performance by eliminating generalization hierarchies and ensuring data integrity through rigorous schema verification. I also designed indexes, considering the workload and optimizing query performance.

•	SQL Implementation and Optimization: I developed the SQL scripts to create the database schema, populate it, and implement complex queries, views, functions, procedures, and triggers. Additionally, I performed physical design validation, using PostgreSQL to generate execution plans and measure performance before and after implementing the physical schema.
